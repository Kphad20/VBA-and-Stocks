# VBA & Stocks

## Backround
In this assignment, I will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

## Files
[Test Data](02-VBA-Scripting/02-VBA-Homework-Instructions/Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing scripts.
</br>

[Stock Data](02-VBA-Scripting/02-VBA-Homework-Instructions/Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run scripts on this data to generate the final report.

## Task
Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
1. The ticker symbol.
2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4. The total stock volume of the stock.
5. Additionally, have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Challenges
1. My solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
2. Make the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
